            <h4>Befor moving ahead keep few points in mind</h4>
            <li>Only adopt a dog if you can spend time with it.</li>
            <li>Ask yourself how much responsible you are, because dogs need a lot of care.</li>
            <li>If you adopt one make sure you give him freedom. Dogs should not be tied to a leash all day.</li>

                <h2 class="dog-breed">What breed of dog is right for me?</h2>
                <p class="para">The wide variety of dog breeds means there is a suitable dog for almost everyone. 
                    However, all breeds have very different needs, so it's important to base your choice on lifestyle rather than appearance. 
                    For example, Siberian Huskies are bred to run, so they are alone in the apartment all day, and in the evening to the store he does not like to walk ten minutes. 
                    Many purebred dogs are also prone to certain health issues that need to be carefully researched before choosing.</p>

            <h2 class="dog-afford">Can I afford a dog?</h2>
            <p class="para">Dogs are expensive. Initial acquisition or acquisition cost is just the beginning. 
                They have to be fed, dewormed and vaccinated on a standard basis, and accidents and illnesses can cost more. 
                Your dog can be with you for 15 years and older dogs like ours often need medication. 
                Even when purchasing, the dog's overall cost of living is an important consideration.</p>

                Remember that temperament is genetic. 
                Parents' temperaments are often passed on to puppies.</p>

            <h2>Gromming</h2>
            <p>When most people think of pet grooming, images of grinding, brushing and chasing pets come to mind. 
            Some people have the misconception that animals don't need to be cared for. 
            However, it is an important aspect of your pet's overall well-being and health. 
            Pet care is also important for the whole family. <br><br>
            You don't want your dirty, smelly pet jumping on your couch or your clean sheets.
            Proper pet care can eliminate shedding, fleas, ticks, and a variety of other health problems. 
            Proper grooming is more than just having a cute pet. 
            Grooming your pet also addresses potentially unhealthy conditions. 
            It can also help identify underlying medical conditions and diseases early. 
            So you can bring your hairy friend to therapy faster and more efficiently.</p>
